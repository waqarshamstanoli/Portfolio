              At BODYSHAKE® we have set the bar high: We want to contribute to a
              healthier society. We believe that quality protein drinks should
              be an essential part of balanced nutrition and an active
              lifestyle.
            </p>
            <p class="text--body-1 white--text ffHalyard mt-4">
              The future is not only healthy but also fully digital. That is why
              we decided to combine providing healthy drinks with state of the
              art hardware and software solutions.
            </p>
            <p class="text--body-1 white--text ffHalyard mt-4">
              Connecting both disciplines enables us to shape a future in which
              everybody has access to healthy nutrition - no matter where, no
              matter when. We want to reach this goal together with strong
              partners - together with you.
